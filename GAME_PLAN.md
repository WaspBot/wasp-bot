## 🛠️ Technical Implementation Details

### Core Architecture Patterns

#### 1. Event-Driven Architecture

```
EventDispatcher (Central Hub)
    ├── Market Data Events (Tickers, OrderBooks, Trades)
    ├── Order Events (Filled, Cancelled, Rejected)
    ├── Balance Events (Updates, Transfers)
    └── System Events (Connector Status, Errors)
```

#### 2. Plugin-Based Connector System

```
BaseConnector (Abstract Class)
    ├── BinanceConnector
    ├── KuCoinConnector
    ├── KrakenConnector
    └── PaperTradingConnector
```

#### 3. Strategy Framework

```
BaseStrategy (Abstract Class)
    ├── PureMarketMaking
    ├── CrossExchangeMarketMaking
    ├── ArbitrageStrategy
    └── CustomStrategy (User-defined)
```

### Data Flow Architecture

```
Market Data → Connectors → Event Dispatcher → Strategies → Order Manager → Connectors → Exchange
```

### Key Technical Decisions

#### Type Safety

- Use strict TypeScript configuration
- Decimal.js for financial calculations (avoid floating point errors)
- Strong typing for all market data and orders
- Runtime type validation for external data

#### Performance

- Event batching for high-frequency updates
- Connection pooling for HTTP requests
- WebSocket connection management with reconnection logic
- In-memory caching for frequently accessed data

#### Reliability

- Circuit breaker pattern for exchange connections
- Retry mechanisms with exponential backoff
- Comprehensive error handling and logging
- Graceful degradation when exchanges are unavailable
